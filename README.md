# magic_mirror_earthx2018

Descrption: 
This is a repository for the EarthX Hackathon 2018.
As of now we are a group of two UTD undergraduates, Gina Fossati and Alejandro Mestanza

Together we are attempting to repurpose a broken laptop to a smart mirror using a raspberry pi. 

Goals/procedure: 
1: Connect a laptop monitor to a raspberry pi 
2: Splice a laptop webcam to usb, and use the pi to display webcam output to the monitor
3: Convert a laptop keyboard to usb output and use the keyboard to manipulate some basic gui on the monitor
4: Build a smart-mirror type gui to display relevant info on the screen (editable through keyboard input).
5: Build (3-d print) a stand and enclosure for the various parts
