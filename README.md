# magic_mirror_earthx2018

Descrption: 
This is a repository for the EarthX Hackathon 2018.
As of now we are a group of two UTD undergraduates, Gina Fossati and Alejandro Mestanza

Together we are attempting to repurpose a broken laptop to a smart mirror using a raspberry pi. 

Updated plan of attack as of Saturday 16:00

Goals/procedure: 

1: Connect a laptop monitor to a raspberry pi (doable, with provided monitor)

2: Splice a laptop webcam to usb, and use the pi to display webcam output to the monitor (undoable)

3: Convert a laptop keyboard to usb output and use the keyboard to manipulate some basic gui on the monitor (undoable)

4: Build a smart-mirror type gui to display relevant info on the screen (editable through keyboard input). (doable)

5: Build (3-d print) a stand and enclosure for the various parts 

6: Add camera functions for gui manipulation based off user input.

  Specifically:
  
    Calendar
    
    Weather
    
    Filters (b/w, sepia, bright contrast)
    
    Screenshot (with timer)
    
    Perform gesture, save and tie action to it
